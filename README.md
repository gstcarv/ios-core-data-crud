Simple CRUD application with the purpose of learn and apply some features present on Swift and on UIKit. The main feature explored was the Core Data, which can save and retrieve large data quantity using SQLite on IOS

The application is just a simple contact list which the users can add, remove, edit and list known people, and they will be saved on Core Data to be persisted even if the user close the application.
